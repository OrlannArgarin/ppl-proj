# Kidz Programming Language
A programming language designed to teach kids some basic programming.

# Usage
**MAKE SURE TO HAVE MINGW INSTALLED AND/OR MAKE IN YOUR COMPUTER**

Download everything inside the "ppl-proj" folder and put it somewhere you want.

Running this language requires you to enter commands in the terminal or command prompt window. 

In Windows 11, open the ppl-proj folder and right click on an empty space. Click "Open in Terminal".
You can skip changing file directory if you've done this correctly.

In Windows 10, open command prompt by pressing win key + r and typing "cmd" then press Enter. Proceed to the next section.

## To compile .c files:
1. Be on the same directory level with the Makefile. To change directory, use "cd" command in the terminal
>Example: cd C:\Users\Orlann\Desktop\sample\ppl-proj
2. Enter the command "make" or "mingw32-make"
3. The file "hello.exe" will be created on the same level with the Makefile

## To run a .kidz program:
1. Be on the same directory level with the "hello.exe" file
2. Run a .kidz program using the format "./hello \<filepath\>" or "hello \<filepath\>":
>Example: ./hello examples/program.kidz
